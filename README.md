# Pokemon Showdown Bot Repository

The goal of this repo is to create an ongoing bot to play in Smogon OU.

We will be using the `poke-env` pip package to abstract the Pokemon Showdown API.
We wil also be using a specific fork of the Pokemon Showdown Simulator, since that has uncapped move rates for faster training.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

<b> Note that this is not set up as a python package as of yet, so non-module imports will be necessary. </b>
